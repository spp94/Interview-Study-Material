SERVICE REGISTRY
-----------------

When we have multiple services instances running, it's difficult for the microservices to know which REST API URL to hit for calling a microservices.
Hence, we needed a way out to keep a track of all the microservices instances along with then names. 
Take it as something like, phone book which has all the phone numbers along with usernames and there address.

Client Side Service Registry
-----------------------------
User ------------------> www.google.com/pizzas
        1st api call            |
     		                    |
								|                                       2nd API call done by client
							Gives the phone number of the pizza shop ---------------------------------> Pizza Shop

Here, the client will get the phone number from the google and make a call to the shop and order a pizza. This is not recommended way as client has to 
make two api calls.							
Can be achived using Eureka.

Server Side Service Registry
-----------------------------
                                                        Call Room 111
User -------------------->  Calls to Hotel Reception ----------------------> Reception will forward it to the room number 111.

Here, the client does only 1 api call, the api gateway with the help of service registry make a call to appropriate API.
Can be achived using NGINX, AWS.
