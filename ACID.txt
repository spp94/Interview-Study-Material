ACID Properties

Atomicity
----------

Either ALL or NONE.

Transaction
Read(A)
Write(A)
Read(B)
Write(B)

Either the entire transaction will complete or will not be done at all if it fails at any point.
Example: We choose Language, enter amount, then PIN. If the transaction fails we need to start it all over again.



Consistency
------------
The state before and after the transaction should be same.

A has Rs.2000 and Rs. 3000
Initial Sum = 5000

Now if A transfer Rs. 1000 to B, 

A has Rs.1000 and Rs.4000
Final Sum = 5000

Hence it's a consistent transaction.

Sometimes, it happens that we get the message for amount being debited from account. But the cash did not came out of ATM.
This is a case of inconsistent transaction. Here, the transaction will be roll backed and we get back our money in account.


Isolation
----------
All the transaction should happen in parallel, any other transaction should not impact each other.
Example: When we go in a Hotel and there are many people ordering food. But our order is not being impacted by what the other person is ordering.



Durability
-----------

The changes should be permanent. Whatever transaction happens it should be saved in the Database.
