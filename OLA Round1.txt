A complete binary tree has every level except possibly the last, completely filled, with all nodes as far left as possible.

Output: No

Input: Node = 7
Output: Yes

To find the level where element exists(if) : O(Height)
Print all the elements at a level: if element exists 


Node Node {
private int value;
private Node left;
private Node right;
}

int data
private boolean 


Node current = root;
int level = 1;
while(current.right != null)
{
 if(current.value > data)
 {
    return;
 }
 level++:
 current = current.right;
}
